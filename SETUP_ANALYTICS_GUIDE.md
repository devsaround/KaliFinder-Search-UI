# Setup Analytics for Anonymous Users

This guide shows you how to set up analytics tracking so that anonymous user interactions from your search widget show up in your dashboard.

## Step 1: Get Your Vendor and Store IDs

Run this command in your backend directory to get your vendor and store IDs:

```bash
cd /Users/pantornchuavallee/kalifind/allIn/KaliFind-Backend
node ../cdn-production/get-vendor-ids.js
```

This will show you:
- Your vendor ID
- Your store IDs (Shopify/WooCommerce)
- The exact script tags you need to use

## Step 2: Update Your Search Script Implementation

Once you have your IDs, update your search script implementation on your store website:

### For Shopify Stores:
```html
<script src="https://your-cdn-domain.com/kalifind-search.js?storeUrl=https://your-store.myshopify.com&vendorId=YOUR_VENDOR_ID&storeId=YOUR_STORE_ID"></script>
```

### For WooCommerce Stores:
```html
<script src="https://your-cdn-domain.com/kalifind-search.js?storeUrl=https://your-store.com&vendorId=YOUR_VENDOR_ID&storeId=YOUR_STORE_ID"></script>
```

## Step 3: Test the Analytics Flow

1. **Open your store website** with the updated search script
2. **Use the search functionality** - type queries, click on products, add to cart
3. **Check your dashboard** - the analytics should update in real-time
4. **Open browser console** to see UBI client logs

## Step 4: Verify Analytics Are Working

### Check Browser Console
Look for these logs in your browser console:
```
UBI Client: Found vendor ID from global variable: YOUR_VENDOR_ID
UBI Client: Flushing events to backend: {...}
```

### Check Backend Logs
Look for these logs in your backend:
```
âœ… Events sent to Firehose successfully
ðŸ“Š Events stored locally for analytics
```

### Check Dashboard
Your dashboard should show:
- Total searches increasing
- Click-through rates updating
- Recent searches appearing in the table

## Step 5: Debug Issues

If analytics aren't working:

### 1. Check Vendor ID Match
Make sure the `vendorId` in your search script matches the user ID in your dashboard.

### 2. Check Network Requests
Open browser DevTools â†’ Network tab and look for:
- Requests to `/api/ubi/collect` (should return 200 status)
- Requests to `/v1/analytics/vendor/YOUR_ID/dashboard` (should return data)

### 3. Check Backend Logs
Look for errors in your backend console:
```
Failed to send UBI events: [error details]
UBI collection error: [error details]
```

### 4. Use Debug Page
Open `http://localhost:5173/debug-analytics.html` to test the analytics flow directly.

## Expected Data Flow

```
1. User visits store website
   â†“
2. Search script loads with vendorId and storeId
   â†“
3. User interacts with search (types, clicks, adds to cart)
   â†“
4. UBI client tracks events with correct vendor ID
   â†“
5. Events sent to backend /api/ubi/collect
   â†“
6. Backend stores events in LocalAnalyticsService
   â†“
7. Dashboard fetches data using same vendor ID
   â†“
8. Dashboard shows updated analytics
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Dashboard shows 0 for all metrics
**Solution**: Check that vendor ID in search script matches user ID in dashboard

### Issue: UBI Client shows "No vendor ID found, using unknown"
**Solution**: Make sure you're passing vendorId parameter in the script URL

### Issue: Events not reaching backend
**Solution**: Check CORS settings and backend URL configuration

### Issue: Dashboard data not updating
**Solution**: Check that the dashboard is using the same vendor ID as the search script

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Test search script with parameters
curl "http://localhost:5173/kalifind-search.js?storeUrl=https://your-store.com&vendorId=123&storeId=456"

# Test analytics endpoint
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/v1/analytics/vendor/123/dashboard" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --cookie "session=your-session-cookie"

# Test UBI collection endpoint
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/ubi/collect" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '[{"event_name":"search_submitted","event_details":{"search_query":"test"},"timestamp":"2024-01-01T00:00:00Z","session_id":"test","anonymous_id":"test","vendor_id":"123","store_id":"456"}]'
```

## Success Indicators

âœ… **Search script loads without errors**
âœ… **Browser console shows vendor ID detection**
âœ… **Network tab shows successful requests to /api/ubi/collect**
âœ… **Backend logs show events being received**
âœ… **Dashboard shows updated metrics after search interactions**
âœ… **Recent searches table populates with actual queries**
